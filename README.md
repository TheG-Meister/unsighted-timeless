# UNSIGHTED - Timeless

UNSIGHTED - Timeless is a mod for 2021 indie metroidvania UNSIGHTED that provides the player with full control over Alma's and all NPCs' remaining time. It was designed with the intention of a "One Hour Challenge" in which everyone starts with only an hour left to life, and Meteor Dust only provides one additional hour.

Despite this, there is a bountiful settings menu with options for:
* Enabling and disabling the plugin
* Presets
* Alma's remaining time
* NPC remaining time
* Remaining time for NPCs that do not accept Meteor Dust
* Time gained from Meteor Dust
* Disabling the harvesting of NPCs for player time using M
* The quantity of Meteor Dust given to the player after defeating M
* Starting in the Gear Village, preventing preparation in the prologue
* Instant death - killing Alma as soon as her time runs out rather than on scene change
* Passing time in Crater Tower
* Removing clock components
* Removing pesky, unskippable low-on-time cutscenes for Alma and Iris

This gets especially hard on the Robot Apocalypse difficulty, during which time travels over twice as fast!

## Installation

This setup guide is for v1.0.0.

__Note__ - if you are using the Xbox Gamepass version this tutorial may not work for you. Contact The G-Meister via the contact methods at the bottom of the page as there may be a way to get it to work.

### BepInEx

This mod runs using BepInEx, a mod manager for Unity games that allows multiple mods to exist side-by-side, and helps resolve conflicts between them. Installing BepInEx is simple and it can be uninstalled by simply renaming the `BepInEx` folder it creates. Once installed, installing a mod is as simple as putting the mod `.dll` file inside the `BepInEx/plugins/` folder.

If you already have BepInEx v5 installed, skip this section.
* Head to the [BepInEx v5.4.21 release page](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) and download `BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip`
* Extract the contents of this zip __in place__ to your game's root directory. If you've installed the game through Steam, this is usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Unsighted`. If unzipping creates a folder with the same name as the `.zip` file, move the contents of this folder (should just be a `BepInEx` folder) into the game's root directory
* Restart your computer
* Run the game once to generate configuration files. You'll know this has succeeded if the `BepInEx/plugins` folder exists in your game's directory

### Mods

From here on, all mods can be installed by downloading them from the links provided and extracting them __in place__ into your game's root directory.
